      <h2>Write down your stories</h2>
      <p>
        First, work out which stories you’d like to tell. Make a list of key moments in your career (e.g. accomplishments, failures, team situations, leadership situations, etc.) that you can use to answer one or multiple questions. Take a look at your target company’s main attributes and their core values, then find at least one story from your past that exemplifies each one.
      </p>
      <p>
        After you’ve finished your list, write out a story for each key moment in your career using the structure we've laid out in section 3. Be sure to emphasize your impact in each of these examples, quantify the results of your actions, and explain the lessons you learned from the experience.
      </p>
      <p>
        Once you have a bank of stories, go through the questions in sections 1 and 2 and make sure you’d be able to answer all of them either by using one of the stories you’ve written directly, or by adapting it on the fly. If you identify any gaps, add stories to your bank until you’re comfortable you can cover all the questions listed in this article.
      </p>
      <h2>Practice your stories out loud</h2>
      <p>
        After you've written everything down, a great way to practice your answers is to interview yourself out loud. This may sound strange, but it will significantly improve the way you communicate during an interview.
      </p>
      <p>
        You should be able to tell each story naturally, neither missing key details nor memorizing them word-for-word.
      </p>
      <p>
        Play the role of both the candidate and the interviewer, asking questions and answering them, just like two people would in an interview. Trust us, it works.
      </p>
      <h2>Practice with peers</h2>
      <p>
        Practicing by yourself will only take you so far. By yourself, you can’t simulate thinking on your feet or the pressure of performing in front of a stranger. Plus, there are no unexpected follow-up questions and no feedback.
      </p>
      <p>
        That’s why many candidates try to practice with friends or peers. If you have friends or peers who can do mock interviews with you, that's an option worth trying. It’s free, but be warned, you may come up against the following problems:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>It’s hard to know if the feedback you get is accurate</li>
        <li>They’re unlikely to have insider knowledge of interviews at your target company</li>
        <li>On peer platforms, people often waste your time by not showing up</li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        For those reasons, many candidates skip peer mock interviews and go straight to mock interviews with an expert.
